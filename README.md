BDD-Air
=======

This is a sample app to demonstrate BDD. We will implement a small
feature for airline ticket reservation.

The feature is outlined
[here](https://github.com/arunsark/bdd-air/blob/master/features/booking_flight_tickets.feature)

The idea is to drive out the design of the system starting with
failing Acceptance Test. Drill down from there build the Business
Logic and mix up persistence and UI components.

The language used in Ruby and BDD Framework comprises of Cucumber &
RSpec.

Eventually we will add a web-framework which will be either Rails or
Sinatra.
